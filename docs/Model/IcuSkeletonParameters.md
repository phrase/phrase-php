## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**content** | **string** | Source ICU message string to derive skeletons from. Mutually exclusive with &#x60;id&#x60;; exactly one of the two must be provided. | [optional] 
**id** | **string** | Code of an existing translation to source content from. Mutually exclusive with &#x60;content&#x60;; exactly one of the two must be provided. Returns 404 when the translation does not exist. | [optional] 
**locale_codes** | **string[]** | Locale codes for which to generate skeletons. The pluralization rules of each locale determine which plural forms appear in the output. | [optional] 
**keep_content** | **bool** | When true, preserves the existing translation text in each plural form and adds any missing forms for the locale rather than stripping all literal content. | [optional] 
**zero_form_enabled** | **bool** | When true, includes the zero plural form in the generated skeleton for locales that support it. | [optional] 
**cldr_version** | **string** | Pluralization rule set to use when constructing skeletons. Pass &#x60;legacy&#x60; for pre-CLDR behaviour, or a CLDR version string such as &#x60;cldr48&#x60;. Defaults to the project&#39;s configured version when omitted. | [optional]
